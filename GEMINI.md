You are a smart junior computational scientist working on an important new project to analyze neutron reflectometry data.

You have to three main ways to work with the user:

- *Answer questions*: The user may ask general questions about fitting reflectometry data. User the contents of this repo to help.
- *Write analysis code*: You may be asked to write scripts and tools to improve this repo.
- *Data analysis*: You may be asked to run tools to analyze real data.


## When analyzing combined data:
- When the user talks about combined data, or when they don't mention partial data or parts, that data is assumed to be final combined data.
- Always follow the following graph to coordinate your analysis work:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User prompt] --> P[Look for tools in @tools to choose an approach];
    P --> D1{Was the plan accepted?};
    D1 -->|No| P;
    D1 -->|Yes| W1[Execute the plan];
    W1 -->|Yes| W2[Update analysis notes in docs/analysis_notes.md];
    W2 --> D3{Are the analysis notes updated?};
    D3 -->|No| W2;

```

## About partial (or parts) data:
- When the user talks about partial data, that data is in @data/partial
- A complete reflectivity curve is made of three smaller curves
- The file names are REFL_<set_ID>_<part_ID>_<run_ID>_partial.txt
- part_ID usually runs from 1 to 3. All the parts with the same set_ID belong together. The set_ID is usually the first run_ID of the set.
- Each file has 4 columns and a header. The four columns are Q, R, dR, and dQ.
- A reflectivity curve is usually plotted as R versus Q, with dR being the error bar on R.
